# Governance and Responsibility

Shadowing this project is the Opentensor Foundation, a globally distributed, non-profit organization that is responsible for navigating the off-chain aspects of Bittensor. Ownership of the Foundation is also shared amongst network contributors through a system of tokenization - where donations of Tao confer ownership and decision-making power.
